# Rotate 2D Matrix

This repository includes interview coding challenges.

## Tasks Completed

- [x] **Task 0: Rotate 2D Matrix**
  - File: [0-rotate_2d_matrix.py](0-rotate_2d_matrix.py)
  - Description: Contains a module with a function that rotates an `n` x `n` 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise with the following specifications:
    - Prototype: `def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):`.
    - In-place editing of the matrix is required; no return value.
    - Assumptions: The matrix will have 2 dimensions and won't be empty.
